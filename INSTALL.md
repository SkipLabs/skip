# Installation instructions

## Skiplang tool chain

### Dependencies

You will need at least the following installed:

 * LLVM 15.
 * wasm-ld 15 (this is part of LLVM, but your distribution might split it into
   a separate package: your wasm-ld version must match your LLVM version).
 * typescript 5.7 or later.
 
### Building the toolchain

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/SkipLabs/skip.git
cd skip
cd skiplang/compiler
make
```

### Installing the toolchain

```make install prefix=<instalation_dir_prefix>```

`<instalation_dir_prefix>/bin` and `<instalation_dir_prefix>/lib` directories will be created.

Then make sure <instalation_dir_prefix>/bin is available in $PATH.

## Native Skip runtime

The native runtime is currently only available for Node.

### Building the native runtime

To build the native Skip runtime, you need the Skiplang toolchain. You can install the tool chain by following the instructions above.

```sh
cd skip
skargo b -r --manifest-path=skipruntime-ts/native/Skargo.toml --lib --out-dir=<target_dir>
```

### Installing the `@skipruntime/native` package

```SKIPRUNTIME=<target_dir> npm install @skipruntime/native```
