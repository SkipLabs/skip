 ----- ERROR
Error: line 4, characters 1-1:
Joins outside of virtual views are considered bad practice in skdb.
You should first create a virtual view joining t1 and t2 with a query of the form:

create virtual view t1_t2 as select * from t1, t2 where a = b;

And then use t1_t2 directly.
PS: You can ignore this error message with --always-allow-joins (not recommended).
PS2: don't forget you can add indexes to virtual views.
