/**
 * A Skip reactive service encapsulating a reactive computation.
 *
 * A reactive Skip service is defined by a class implementing this `SkipService` interface.
 *
 * Skip services operate over data organized into _collections_, each of which has a unique string name and associates _keys_ to one or more _values_.
 * The contents of collections are computed from initial data, other collections, or reactive or non-reactive external resources.
 *
 * A Skip service's `Inputs` are collections that start populated with the `initialData`.
 * The input collections is the mechanism by which a Skip service can accept writes.
 * See `runService` for the write requests of the HTTP API, and `SkipServiceBroker` for the write operations of the method-call API.
 *
 * It can be useful to think of the structure of a service's computation as a directed acyclic graph, the _reactive computation graph_, where the vertices are the named collections, and the edges are the functions (`Mapper`s and `Reducer`s) that produce collections from other collections.
 * Part of the graph is structured in a way that is not dependent on the data or requests the service encounters at runtime: it is _static_.
 * The rest of the graph is _dynamic_ in the sense that collections/vertices are added in response to requests and data received at runtime by the service.
 * The static portion of the graph is defined by `createGraph`, which receives the service's input collections.
 * The result of `createGraph` is the boundary of the static reactive computation graph: named collections that are made available to the dynamic reactive computation graph as inputs to the `instantiate` computations of `Resource`s.
 *
 * `Resource`s are the mechanism by which a service's collections are exposed to other services and clients for reading.
 * A `Resource` implementation provides an `instantiate` function which is similar to `createGraph` but receives the boundary collections of the static reactive computation graph and only produces a single collection.
 * The simplest `Resource`s just return one of the collections they receive as an argument, thereby exposing a collection that would otherwise be internal to the service.
 * `Resource`s define the _dynamic_ portion of the reactive computation graph that arises in response to requests and data at runtime, extending the _static_ computation graph.
 *
 * `Resource`s are exposed by a `SkipService` implementation providing `resources` that associates resource names to `Resource` constructors.
 * The interface involves class constructor functions for `Resource`s since they are instantiated at runtime by the Skip framework in response to requests, using parameters provided as part of the request.
 * When a `SkipService` receives a request, the corresponding `Resource` constructor is called with parameters obtained from the request, the resource object's `instantiate` function is called to produce a collection containing the results.
 * Depending on the request, the requestor can read these results synchronously or subscribe to a stream of update events.
 * Resource result collections are maintained up-to-date, with updates being reactively pushed to subscribers.
 * See `runService` for the HTTP API for reading resources, and `SkipServiceBroker` for a method-call API.
 *
 * Some of a Skip service's collections, those of type `EagerCollection`, are eagerly kept up-to-date by the framework.
 * This includes the static portion of the reactive computation graph, so the static portion serves as pre-computed data that can be used by individual requests.
 * The result collections produced by instantiating `Resource`s are also eager and kept up-to-date.
 * Note that this implies that the static portion of the reactive computation graph, as well as the results of resources, are eagerly updated when the service receives a write to an input collection.
 * The computation of a `Resource`'s output collection may use intermediate collections that are either eager or lazy.
 * A lazy collection, of type `LazyCollection`, is one where the entries are only computed on-demand as a result of querying particular keys.
 * Lazy collections memoize computations that are performed as part of computing the result of an update to an input of an eager collection.
 * Lazy collections cannot be directly exposed as resources, but a couple auxiliary eager collections can be used to achieve the same effect.
 *
 * Skip services can also make use of external services to compute their results.
 * Within the bodies of `SkipService.createGraph` or `Resource.instantiate`, an external service can be accessed using `Context.useExternalResource`.
 * `Context.useExternalResource` accepts the name of an external service, which must be associated to an instance of the `ExternalService` interface by the `externalServices`, as well as a resource the external service provides and parameters for it, and returns an eager collection of the contents of the resource provided by the external service.
 * The resulting eager collection can then be incorporated into the reactive computation graph just like any other.
 *
 * @typeParam Inputs - The service's input collections.
 * @typeParam ResourceInputs - Collections provided to the resource computation by the service's `createGraph`.
