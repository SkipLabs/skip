# Glossary

 This page defines and briefly explains the terminology and main concepts of the
 Skip framework.

* _Skip_: An open-source framework that enables software developers to build and
  run reactive services and systems.  *Skip* is an overarching term to refer to
  the full ecosystem of tools and components described here.

* _Skiplang_: The Skip programming language, used by _SkipLabs_ to implement the
  core logic and data structures underpinning the *Skip* system.

* _(Skip) Runtime_: A full-fledged reactive computation engine, implemented
  in Skiplang and made available via bindings in other languages.  The core
  components of the runtime are *collections* and *mappers*, which together form
  a graph of data and computation dependencies that the engine can use to
  efficiently maintain reactive computations as inputs and data are updated.

* _Service_: A single-host reactive service implemented using the Skip
  runtime.  A service provides reactive *resources* which can be accessed by
  clients or other reactive services, which specify parameters and are provided
  with reactively-updated data computed and maintained by the service.  A
  service consists of some *input collections*, metadata to access *external
  services* (other Skip services and/or non-Skip HTTP endpoints) and a
  computation graph defining how to produce outputs from its inputs.

* _Resource_: The output of a Skip service is one or more *resources*, which are
  updated and maintained reactively. Requests against resources can include
  parameters, and the corresponding results -- a *resource instance* specific to
  that client and request parameters -- are computed/updated until the client
  disconnects or unsubscribes.  Non-reactive requests can also be made, allowing
  legacy clients to query reactive services' resources.

* _Collection_: The core data structure over which reactive computations
  operate, collections associate *keys* with one or more *values*, both of
  which can be arbitrary JSON data.  Collections can either be *eager*, meaning
  they are always kept up-to-date, or *lazy*, meaning that values are only
  computed and/or updated in response to queries for a particular key.

* _Mapper_: Mappers describe computations from keys/values in one collection to
  keys/values in another collection. They form the _edges_ of the Skip reactive
  computation graph, specifying transformations and compositions of data to
  produce intermediate results and outputs.  Crucially, they must be
  deterministic and side-effect free, so that the reactive runtime can
  re-execute them as needed to maintain results that are both up-to-date and
  guaranteed from-scratch consistent. (i.e. exactly the same as the result that
  would be computed if the equivalent non-reactive computation were executed
  from scratch on the current input)

* _(Skip) Client_: A thin client for a Skip reactive service which does not
  itself use the Skip Runtime, but operates over data which is kept up-to-date
  by the service.
