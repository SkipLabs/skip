# Services and Resources

The Skip framework supports end-to-end reactive programming: computations are evaluated reactively within each service, and data is pushed eagerly from reactive services to their consumers.

We've already seen the _intra_-service abstractions -- collections, mappers, and the like -- that make up a reactive service's computation graph (see the [getting started](getting_started.md) and [writing functions](functions.md) pages).

This page describes the concepts and abstractions that make up the _inter_-service communication layer.
