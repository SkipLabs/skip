**The News**

We’re pleased to announce that SkipLabs has raised $8 million to bring incremental computing to applications everywhere.  We intend to use the entirety of this funding to enhance the open source Skip project and grow the developer community.

This financing also means we get to work with [Lenny Pruss](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lennypruss/) at Amplify Partners who have invested in some of today’s most prominent developer platforms such as dbt Labs, Prisma and Temporal to name a few and [Alex Mackenzie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-mackenzie-6aa80ab4/) at Tapestry VC.  Check out Amplify’s [blog post](https://www.amplifypartners.com/blog-posts/how-skiplabs-is-building-react-for-the-backend) that shares their view on SkipLabs and the future of reactive systems and Tapestry’s [blog post](https://www.tapestry.vc/perspectives/skiplabs-streaming-without-the-streams) on why they chose to invest.

We are also humbled to earn the support of individual investors like Adam Gross, Spencer Kimball, Yann LeCun, Tom Occhino, Olivier Pomel and Nicolas Vasilache.

**2025 so far…**

We launched Skip at the start of this year and are very happy with the reception we’ve received so far.  In the first two months since its alpha release, the Skip project has received more than 1,000 stars on github, more than 1,000 unique installations while our Discord community grew by 400%.

What has been most gratifying are the discussions working with users to apply Skip and incremental computing to making their backend applications fast, secure and easy to enhance.  Developers have used Skip to power real-time crypto trading applications, CRM content management systems and sports tournament management.

We look forward to hundreds more of these collaborations because the opportunity for incremental computing is everywhere, it just wasn’t easy enough to do before Skip.  Thanks to Skip, incremental computing will become the simplest way of building services that:

- Power real-time features
- Source data from more than one place with more than one latency
- Serve distinct views to diverse clients that are a combination of browser, mobile, agent and API
- Move security and privacy implementations from the client to the server

**The Road Ahead**

The Skip Framework is new, but it’s built on very mature technical foundations developed while we were at Meta.  We plan to incorporate feedback from the community for a few months more before we ship a beta release so we can be confident in our backward compatibility commitments.

In the meantime we have lots of exciting new features to ship.  In the past few weeks we’ve already added prebuilt external resources for Postgres and Kafka, a more efficient natively compiled runtime and native OAuth support.

In the months ahead we plan to add:

- Horizontal autoscaling
- A built-in debugger that builds on Skip’s transactional heap to provide unprecedented visibility at runtime
- Support for additional backend programming languages


**Thank You**

Our deepest gratitude to our users, investors, advisors and early employees who have believed in and supported SkipLabs’ mission of incremental computing since the earliest days.  We’ll keep shipping and proving you were right all along.  Back to work!
