We’re pleased to share the alpha release of the [Skip Framework](https://github.com/SkipLabs/skip), an open source (MIT license) system for building and running reactive backend services.

Skip gives TypeScript developers a simple declarative way to implement and run read-mostly features and services that are performant, transparent and continuously updated.
The framework handles all the complexities of state management, integrations and failure handling in the process.

You can install via:

```
npm i @skiplabs/skip
```

This is an alpha release \- we are happy with its stability and functionality but are looking forward to feedback on the interfaces and developer experience.

If you have time to check it out over the holidays and have feedback or just questions, [come talk to us in discord](https://discord.gg/4dMEBA46mE).

Happy holidays,

The SkipLabs team
