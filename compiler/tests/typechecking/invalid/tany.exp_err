[Internal Error] The type cannot be resolved. It is likely a type parameter that has not received a concrete type argument in this typechecking context. Often this can be worked around by supplying a type annotation: for example, if you write Vector[], it may suffice to write (e.g.) Vector<String>[]. Note that this is a limitation of the current type system - your code is probably not at fault. (site=is_mutable)
